# unit-4-game

The goal of this game is to match, but not exceed the randomly-generated score by clicking on each of the crystal buttons. 

Each button has a randomly-generated value of between 1 and 12.

If the user matches the computer's score, they win, but if they exceed the score, they lose. The random button values and the score to match are regenerated after each win or loss.

This game was coded by me, and is maintained by me.
